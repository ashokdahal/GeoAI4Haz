# Introduction
This short sections will familiarize you with some free external materials on Neural Networks and basics theories behind it. 
This is to support further understanding of the mathematical concept behind the Neural Networks and how we can further use it in Natural Hazards/ Geoscience.

## Where to run things

The excercise notebooks will be available via Canvas and you can run these excercise materials in either CRIB or Google Colab or on your local machine.

## Credits
This lecture notes are prepared based on the original materials by Matteo Ravasi and his group at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). As their material is not available as a separate book I have converted it into the jupyter book and hosted in github for the easiness of reading for the students. Presentation slides, excercise notebooks and dataset are prepared by me and can be downloaded from Canvas as it is not copyrighted material.
